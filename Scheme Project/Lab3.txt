Lab 3 - Scheme

1) (3 8 9 2 4 10)
2) Function f adds 1 to each one of the elements
3) Check if the list is null
4) If it is null create an empty list
5) Else create add one to each element by calling the list recursively
6) #f
7) ERROR: Unbound variable: d
8) #f
9) #f
10)(blue eggs cheese ham and sandwich)
11) (and)
12) Once you get the way the methods are built, its not too bad. It just takes a while to get used to having to use recursion every method.
13) Having to think recursively every time kind of bugs me.
14) 6 hours
15) Didn't super enjoy this lab. I probably won't use Scheme again. Good experience though.
